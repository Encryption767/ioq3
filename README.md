	IoQuake3 with D3D12 and Vulkan renderers pulled modified from Quake-III-Arena-Kenny-Edition to work with
	with ioq3 open renderer dll system.

	For Vulkan use \cl_renderer vulkan
	For DirectX12 use \cl_renderer d3d12
	
	I don't personally fool with the make files or linux or mac so I have only used VS and have only updated the 
	solution and project files for that and have only built for windows.
